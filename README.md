Aegis Station Project 
Low Earth Orbit Assembly + Lunar Water Shielding + Deep Space Expansion 
  
1. Executive Summary 
The Aegis Station Project proposes construction of humanity’s first permanent orbital city, assembled in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using heavy-lift rockets. Shielding against radiation will be achieved using lunar-mined water, dramatically cutting launch costs and enabling a scalable platform for deep space exploration, Mars missions, and Solar System expansion. 
  
2. Mission Overview 
	Category 	Detail 
Orbit 	Low Earth Orbit (~400–500 km) 
Structure 	Rotating ring (150m radius) 
Gravity 	0.5g centrifugal 
Crew Size 	60–100 personnel 
Shielding 	1–3 meters lunar-sourced water 
Power 	Solar arrays + nuclear backup 
Docking Ports Crew, cargo, tanker ships 
Expansion 	Modular addition of rings and hubs 
  
3. Strategic Objectives 
✅ Establish permanent orbital human habitation. 
✅ Enable local water harvesting to escape Earth launch limits. 
✅ Support Mars transfer ship construction and fueling. ✅ Begin long-term Solar System industrialization.
